'''
This module simply contains constants used throughout the protocol.

The module defines in particular: 
    * GROUP_P and GROUP_G, constants for group operations
      (those are hardcoded to 2 and and 100103).
    * A null value (F_NULL = -1).
    * An enum class :class:`.RtPolicyReason` that codes
      the reasons of acceptation/refusal of route proposals.

# A flag used during the route proposition process, when the destination
# gets the RtPropAns message, "decrypts" the MaxHopCount-HopCount value,
