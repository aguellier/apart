'''
This module contains classes managing the network. 

The class :class:`~apart.core.network.Network` represents a network, and class
:class:`~apart.core.network.NetworkManager` the manager of the network.The
manager is responsible for triggering the different *phases* of the network
(coded in :class:`~apart.core.network.NetPhase`), and starting the nodes
processes. The network itself contains the topology graph and the list of nodes
that compose the network.

This module does not contain code properly relatin to the protocol. All the code
of the protocol, and the behavior of nodes, is coded in module
:mod:`~apart.core.node`.

This module also defines the :exc:`.SimulationException` exception.
