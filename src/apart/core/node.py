        proposers that itself received a

        self-proposal. In the first case, the node can either be a simple relay

        the return trip from proposee to receiver, and thus two messages are
        necessary. The "first protocol message" is defined as the one carrying
        the encrypted dst**src value (and the encryted temporary public key). A
        node makes the distinction between the first and second protocol
        mesasge, because the later has a rcid different from the first, but
