This repository contains the academic implementation of the protocol
proposed as part of my PhD thesis. This code is made available for the
community to reproduce the results.

Description
-----------

The protocol is aimed at providing ironclad privacy in Internet communications.
It is meant to be run as a peer-to-peer Internet overlay, providing privacy to
individuals around the world. The design is in particular inspired from `Tor
<https://torproject.org/>`__, and builds on the scientific literature about
*mixnets*. It however provides stronger privacy guarantees then existing works.
In particular, the protocol functions on a *homogeneous network*, in which all
nodes simultaneously act as client, and as relay servers for other nodes. This
allows each node to conceal its own traffic in the traffic it relays for other
users.

This repository only contains a basic, insecure implementation of this
protocol, for purposes of measuring the privacy and performances that can be
expected from the protocol. More accurately, it is a *simulation* of the
protocol that is implemented, using the `SimPy
<http://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ discrete-event simulator. The code
also uses the `Networkx <http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ library
to generate and manipulate the network graph, and `matplotlib.pyplot
<http://matplotlib.org/>`__ to draw various graphs.

Getting Started: Running Simulations
------------------------------------

The documentation provides details on how to run simulations, and
gathering statistics on network runs.

To run a simulation, one possibility is to create a ``main.py`` file
that imports the ``apart.simulation`` module. The latter provides a
``run_simulation()`` function, that accepts parameters for the network
(*e.g.* the number of nodes), and for the simulation (*e.g* logging
level, pieces of information that should be recorded during the network
run). The execution of the function may take some time for a number of
node greater than 10. It also makes log outputs to the standard output,
letting the user follow the stages of the simulation. Ultimately, the
function returns a ``NetworkManager`` instance, which in particular
contains a ``net_stat`` attribute, itself containing all gathered
statistics and pieces of information on the network and the simulation.

The user can then exploit these pieces of information in the way she
sees fit. However, it is more interesting to run fully-fledged measure
campaign, in which many simulations are run with different network
parameters. This is possible with the material provided in the
``measures`` package. It provides ways to run many network simulations,
and compute statistics on them. This allows *e.g.* to obtain an average
over many runs and over many possible network topologies of the latency
in communications. The ``measures`` package further provides ways to
draw graphs from the results.

The ``examples/`` folder includes several modules that make use of the
benchmark package ``measures``: 

* ``measure_general_efficiency``, allowing in particular to measure 
  communication latency, 
* ``measure_route_prop``, allowing to measure various metrics on the route
  proposal mechanism proposed in the protocol, 
* ``measure_privacy``, allowing to measure the expected privacy that users 
  get from the protocol. 
* ``measure_all``, that simultaneously performs the measures of all three 
  modules at once.

Note that running these modules may take some time. Parameters for
simulations can be easily changed in the respective *main part* of each
module. The user is also free to create its own modules and construct
custom measure campains (*e.g.* based on the same model as the above
modules)

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available online at https://aguellier.github.io/apart.

The sources of the documentation are located in ``docs/``. Documentation
is generated using Sphinx (v. 1.5.3), and the ReadTheDocs theme (v.
0.2.4). It is thus required to have those packages installed (*via* the
system package manager, pip, or any virtual environment).

To build the documentation (in html format), run ``make html`` while in
the ``docs/`` directory. This creates a ``docs/build/`` folder. You can
then open the file ``docs/build/html/index.html`` in your favorite
browser.

Dependencies
------------

The project is written for Python 3.4, with the following packages and
versions: 

* `Simpy <http://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ 3.0.10
* `Networkx <http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ 1.11 
* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ 1.3.1, for its pyplot sub-package 
* dill 0.2.5

Sphinx 1.5.3 is used to generate the documentation, along with the
ReadTheDocs theme (v. 0.2.4)
