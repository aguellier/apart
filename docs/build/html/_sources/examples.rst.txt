For convenience, the examples that can be found in the `examples/` folder of the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/aguellier/apart>`__ are reported here.

To run a measure, simply run ``python measure_module.py`` for the desired module. The `main` part of these modules can be modified to parameterise the measures, *e.g.* to test the impact of a specific parameter on the performances or privacy of the protocol. Also, other measure modules can be created on the same model as the ones presented here.
